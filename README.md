## JavaScript With Appium

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your **WebDriverIO** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud platform**.

## Objective

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Run a sample automation script of **WebDriverIO** for application testing with **Appium** on **LambdaTest**.
2. Run test cases in **parallel** using WebDriverIO with Appium to reduce build times.
3. Learn more about Desired Capabilities for Appium testing.
4. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
- Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s :link: [LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio
cd LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"

**For Windows:**

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
 
### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{\"url\":\"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk\",\"name\":\"sample.apk\"}"`}

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first WebDriverIO test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [Android-test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio/blob/master/specs/android-test.js) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS-test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio/blob/master/specs/ios-test.js) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step-4:** You need to update your capabilities in `*.config.js` files. In this sample project, we have provided the examples for running tests on both **Android** and **iOS** apps. You can find the configs for both iOS and Android in the `iOS-sample` and `android-sample` directories correspondingly. We are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. You need to pass the path of your test script in `specs` object to run your own automation script. The capabilities object in the sample code for a single test are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="ios-single.conf.js" default>

```javascript title="ios/ios-single.conf.js"
exports.config = {
  user: process.env.LT_USERNAME || "YOUR_USERNAME",
  key: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY || "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",

  updateJob: false,
  //highlight-next-line
  specs: ["./../specs/ios-test.js"], //path of your test script
  exclude: [],

  //highlight-start

    {
      build: "NodeJS WebDriverIO iOS",
      name: "Sample Test - WebDriverIO",
      isRealMobile: true,
      deviceName: "iPhone 13 Pro",
      platformVersion: "15",
      platformName: "iOS",
      app: "YOUR_APP_URL",
    },
  ],
  //highlight-end

  port: 80,

  framework: "mocha",
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: "bdd",
    timeout: 20000,
  },
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="android-single.conf.js" default>

```javascript title="android/android-single.conf.js"
exports.config = {
  user: process.env.LT_USERNAME || "YOUR_USERNAME",
  key: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY || "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",

  updateJob: false,
  //highlight-next-line
  specs: ["./../specs/android-test.js"], //path of your test script
  exclude: [],

  //highlight-start
  capabilities: [
    {
      build: "NodeJS WebDriverIO Android",
      name: "Sample Test - WebDriverIO",
      isRealMobile: true,
      platformName: "Android",
      deviceName: "Galaxy S9",
      platformVersion: "10",
      app: "YOUR_APP_URL",
    },
  ],
  //highlight-end

  logLevel: "info",
  coloredLogs: true,
  screenshotPath: "./errorShots/",
  baseUrl: "",
  waitforTimeout: 10000,
  connectionRetryTimeout: 90000,
  connectionRetryCount: 3,
  path: "/wd/hub",
  hostname: "beta-hub.lambdatest.com",
  port: 80,

  framework: "mocha",
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: "bdd",
    timeout: 20000,
  },
};
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here :page_facing_up:](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/) .

### Executing The Tests

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-5:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

```bash
cd ios
```

**Step-6:** Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

**Step-7:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
npm run single
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

If you are using an **android** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding Android app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-5:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

```bash
cd android
```

**Step-6:** Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

**Step-7:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:
